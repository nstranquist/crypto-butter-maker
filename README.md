To the moon...!

### Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file in root of the project and add the contents:
  - API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"
  - API_SECRET="YOUR-API-SECRET-KEY"
  - API_PASSPHRASE="YOUR-API-PASSPHRASE"

2. If desired, modify the `.flaskenv` file to your liking. This will affect the port and some metadata about the flask app

3. To conduct tests, check out scripts in the `/tests` directory
